This project explores the **relationship between Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and global temperature and radiation** using long-term satellite and reanalysis datasets (2000–2019). The analysis investigates how changes in AOD correspond to variations in surface temperature and net radiation on a global scale.

Dataset Source: 
1. AOD --> NASA MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2)
2. Temp , SW-LW Radiation budget --> ERA5 (CRU Data)
   
(All the process of downloading data will be include in AOD-Temp-rad.ipynb script.)

Temporal Coverage: 2000–2019
Resolution: 1° × 1° grid
